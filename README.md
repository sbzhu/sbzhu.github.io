#### Environment

If you have jekyll installed, simply run `jekyll serve` in Command Line
and preview the themes in your browser. You can use `jekyll serve --watch` to watch for changes in the source files as well.


#### Get Started

You can easily get started by modifying `_config.yml` and *_post*:
[Reference Docuement](http://jekyllrb.com/)

#### Extensions
+ Site settings
+ SNS settings      
+ Build settings
+ SideBar
+ Mini About Me
+ Featured Tags
+ Friends

#### Comment

This theme support both [Disqus](http://disqus.com) and [Duoshuo](http://duoshuo.com) as the third party discussion system.

First, you need to sign up and get your own account. **Repeat, DO NOT use mine!** (I have set Trusted Domains) It is deathly simple to sign up and you will get the full power of management system. Please give it a try!

Second, from V1.5, you can easily complete your comment configuration by just adding your **short name** into `_config.yml`:

```
duoshuo_username: _your_duoshuo_short_name_
# OR
disqus_username: _your_disqus_short_name_
```

**To the old version user**, it's better that you pull the new version, otherwise you have to replace code in `post.html`, `keynote.html` and `about.html` by yourselves.

Furthermore, Duoshuo support Sharing. if you only wanna use Duoshuo comment without sharing, you can set `duoshuo_share: false`. You can use Duoshuo Sharing and Disqus Comments together also.



#### Analytics

From V1.5, we support Google Analytics and Baidu Tongji officially with a deathly simple config:

```
# Baidu Analytics
ba_track_id: 4cc1f2d8f3067386cc5cdb626a202900

# Google Analytics
ga_track_id: 'UA-49627206-1'            # Format: UA-xxxxxx-xx
ga_domain: huangxuan.me
```

Just checkout the code offered by Google/Baidu, and copy paste here, all the rest is already done for you.
